  This includes new browser versions too!

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 57d032f: Don't close browser if it's currently creating a PDF. We've added smoke tests, so
  this shouldn't happen again. Sorry!

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- b4ebed6: Allow more options for pdf, context and goto to be passed. Also working validations.

  We allow way more options now to be given in the payload:

  - `pdfOptions` are the options for the `pdf` call in Playwright: https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-pdf.
  - `gotoOptions` are the options for the `goto` method in Playwright: https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-goto
    - if you don't pass anything, we default to a timeout of 60000 and wait for `networkidle`
  - `browserContextOptions` are the options for the browser context in Playwright: https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browser#browser-new-context
    - if you don't pass anything, we default to set `ignoreHTTPSErrors` to `true`

  We finally added tests too! ✌️

  ## Breaking Changes

  - We don't allow `options` in the payload anymore. Those are `pdfOptions` now. To adapt your code, rename `options` to `pdfOptions` and you should be good to go.
    This change was needed to allow more options for other methods we're using (like `timeout` for `goto`).
  - We have stricter validation now and don't allow unknown keys in the option objects now. Previously we've ignored them, but we've now opted to bail out with
    an validation error so the user gets notified on typos and such.

- 484b197: Return an error if page could not be loaded

  ## Breaking Changes

  Previously we've ignored if the page could not be loaded and tried to create a PDF anyway. However,
  this lead to PDFs with random error messages on them, instead of a proper error in logging or similar.

  To provide an better experience, we've opted to change this, so errors are caught earlier.

### Major Changes

- eccf614: Remove TypeScript, use vanilla JS with JSDoc types.

  This actually improves DX by not having that extra build step, while still having
  good support in your IDE, since we still have the types as JSDoc.

  This is the v1.0. This has been very stable and it's unlikely that the API will change
  a lot. Nothing should break for users with this release.
